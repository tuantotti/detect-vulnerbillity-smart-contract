This repo encompasses the code for two multilabel methods:
+ Traditional method (Machine learning): LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, RandomForest, Multi kNN
+ Modern method (Deep learning): LSTM, GRU, BERT-based model.

We also use some feature extraction methods: TF-IDF, BoW, W2V. 
Especially, we use wisdomnet-based method.
